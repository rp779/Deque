# Deque

Basically, all we have done here is wrap a deque inside a class template and let it do all the work. Our function members are essentially just renamings of deque function members. And there is really NO need to do this, because STL has done it for us! This shows power of STL and how much time can conserved in developing containers, such as a stack and a deque.
